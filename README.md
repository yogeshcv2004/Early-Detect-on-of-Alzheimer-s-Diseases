# Early-Detect-on-of-Alzheimer-s-Diseases
Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Diseases is a machine learning-based system designed to identify early signs of Alzheimer’s using medical imaging and cognitive data. The model leverages deep learning techniques such as CNNs to analyze brain scans or retinal OCTA images and classify the stages of the disease.
